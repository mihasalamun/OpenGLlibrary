## OpenGL library

Library for drawing in 2D and 3D. Example usage in my [OpenGL projects](https://github.com/mihasalamun/OpenGLprojects) repo.

*** 

Some code based from/based on [OpenGL tutorials by VictorGordan](https://github.com/VictorGordan/opengl-tutorials/tree/main). 
Also used code from [openal-soft](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft), [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/download.html), [Glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/) and [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb).
